# pike-resume 

A silly-simple XeLaTeX class made for my resume (see
[`resume.tex`](resume.tex)). 

## Usage

If you'd like to use it for your own resume and are not familiar with TeX, you 
can get started quickly with one of the following: 

- MacOS: [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
- Linux/Windows: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

Open up `resume.tex` in TeXShop (included with either) and start playing around. 

You'll also need the Go font (made by [Bigelow &
Holmes](http://bigelowandholmes.typepad.com) for the Go programming language
project and released under the BSD 3-Clause license), which you can get by doing the following: 

`git clone https://go.googlesource.com/image`

Then, installing them from their location in `image/font/gofont/ttfs`.  Read
more about the Go font [here](https://blog.golang.org/go-fonts).
